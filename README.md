# Variadís

### What is Variadís
Variadís is a game that takes the gamble to discover, in a fun way, the flora around you: no need to live in the countryside for this, the city center of Toulouse is full of trees!

Every day, challenges to make: open your map and find a specific plant near you. Earn points to increase your rank! Will you become the first Ecowild among your friends?

* Herbarium gathering all the trees found
* Detailed record of a found tree (date of discovery, place, photo)
* User profile with the possibility of modifying it (photo, number of points, badges, pseudo)
* A random challenge to meet
* View the map of Toulouse with markers of found trees and that of the challenge to take up
